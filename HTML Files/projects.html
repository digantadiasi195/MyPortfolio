            <h3 class="project-title">Multi-Modal Deepfake Detection</h3>
            <p class="project-duration"><strong>Duration:</strong> Aug 2024 - Present</p>
            <p class="project-supervisor"><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Dr. Prashant W. Patil (MFSDSAI) and Dr. Anirban Dasgupta (Dept. of EEE)</p>
            <p class="project-work"><strong>Work:</strong> Developing a multimodal deepfake detection model to classify deepfakes in video-audio combinations of real and
                fake content across four classes by analyzing both audio and video modalities. Utilizing EfficientNet-B7 for frame feature extraction, CNN for audio feature extraction, and Vision Transformer
                for video feature extraction, while applying Contrastive Learning to reduce cross-modal gaps.</p>

            <h3 class="project-title">AI-Based Healthcare Assistant using Large Language Model</h3>
            <p class="project-duration"><strong>Duration:</strong> Jan 2024 - Apr 2024</p>
            <p class="project-supervisor"><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Dr. Chiranjib Sur, MFSDSAI, IIT Guwahati</p>
            <p class="project-work"><strong>Work:</strong> Developed a healthcare assistant by fine-tuning the Llama2-7b language model with a custom dataset from the Gale Encyclopedia of Alternative Medicine, implementing a pipeline to generate responses up to 200 tokens. Employed QLoRA, 4-bit quantization, and Hugging Face libraries for parameter-efficient fine-tuning, achieving 50%
                less RAM usage and 400% faster training while enhancing model performance.</p>

            <h3 class="project-title">Care Vision AI: Disease Diagnosis through AI</h3>
            <p class="project-duration"><strong>Duration:</strong> Jan 2024 - Apr 2024</p>
            <p class="project-supervisor"><strong>Supervisor:</strong> Dr. Debanga Raj Neog, MFSDSAI, IIT Guwahati</p>
            <p class="project-work"><strong>Work:</strong> Created AI models to detect medical conditions such as skin cancer, brain tumors, lung cancer, and pneumonia using custom CNN architecture, SVM, Random Forest, and morphological operations for image processing. Boosted recall by 4% using ResNet50 through Transfer Learning and developed a user-friendly web application
                that integrates these models for efficient, real-time detection and diagnosis.</p>
